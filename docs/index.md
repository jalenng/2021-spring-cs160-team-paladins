# 1 Introduction
<img src="screenshots/monitor_smash.png" alt="iCare icon"/>

## 1.1 Why iCare?

Many of us spend plenty of time staring at the computer screen every day. This can put a lot of strain on our eyes and cause eye fatigue. iCare is a desktop app that uses the 20-20-20 rule to motivate users to develop good habits to avoid eye strain without being too intrusive to their schedule. iCare would suggest users to take a 20-second break every 20 minutes and look at something at least 20 feet away.

<span style="color:#d86c70">Disclaimer : </span>
Please note that iCare is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice. Always seek the advice of your physician or qualified health provider with any questions you may have.

## 1.2 The 20-20-20 rule

For every 20 minutes spent using a screen, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. 

This is done to take care of your eyes in the current digital age where many people spend their day staring at their screens.

While the rule recommends that you look at something that is 20 feet away, being exact isn’t the idea. You should just try to focus on something that is far away from you for 20 seconds, which is the amount of time it takes for your eyes to completely relax.

Of course, most people do not keep track of the time and get absorbed in reading or working when looking at a screen. Using iCare to set a timed reminder to pop up will help you take your needed break to rest your eyes.

# 3 Getting Started

## 3.1 Application overview

In the upper left-hand corner of the iCare window, we have four tabs that refer to four different screens. By default, you start on the first tab, the Home screen, whenever you open the application. The other tabs can only be used if you are logged into an account. 

The second tab, the Usage Statistics screen, shows you data and app usage statistics for the past 7 days if there are any available on the server. The third tab, the Insights screen, shows insights cards that are generated by the iCare application based on any data and application usage statistics you have on the server. The fourth tab is the Preferences screen that shows you your custom user saved preferences on the account.

In the upper right-hand corner, we have the Sign-in button that opens up the Login window. If you are already logged in, it will display your display name there.

## 3.2 Exiting iCare

The iCare window can be hidden by clicking on the application close button. When the application is hidden, it is running and performing its tasks in the background.

To exit iCare, right-click on the iCare icon on the system tray. In the context menu, click “**Quit**”. Once the app quits, it will not be running anymore.

# 4 Timer
## 4.1 Overview of the timer interface

<img src="screenshots/timer_overview.png" alt="Timer Button"/>

_▲The timer on the Home screen_


When you start the iCare application, the timer on the Home screen will start automatically from the default 20 minutes. If you have an account and a customized timer notification interval, the timer will start from that customized interval.

At the end of your timer, a break notification will appear and have you take a 20 second break away from the screen. When your break is over, the timer will automatically start counting down again.

This feature is default by nature and cannot be disabled. If you want your timer to stop, you must press the pause button underneath the timer. Just keep in mind that this will reset the timer back to its default notification interval.

## 4.2 How breaks work
![Break notification](screenshots/break_notif.png)

_▲The popup notification_

![Fullscreen break notification](screenshots/fullscreen_break_notif.png)

_▲The fullsreen notification_

In iCare, a break occurs when the timer finishes, which results in a pop-up notification that indicates the start of the 20 second break. 

While the initial pop-up notification is small, five seconds into the break, the pop-up notification will turn into a full-screen overlay that takes over your screen. During the time the notification or overlay is present, the break timer will reset when it senses any mouse movement.

<span style="color:#ADD8E6">Note</span>
: Notification sound playback is currently unsupported on Linux.

# 6 Usage Statistics

## 6.1 Data Usage

By default, iCare will collect your PC’s data usage statistics associated with your account. It will keep track of the total amount of screen time and the total amount of times the timer has been successfully used per day on the account.

This information will be used for you to keep track of the time you have spent on your device and how much you have been diligently following the 20-20-20 rule over the past 7 days.

![Data usage graph](screenshots/data_usage.png)

_▲Weekly usage shown on the Usage Statistics screen_

If you do not want iCare to collect your data, it is possible to turn off this data collection feature in your account’s user preferences. Furthermore, when you delete your account the data associated with your account will automatically be deleted from our server.


## 6.2 App Usage

By default, iCare will collect information on how much time you spend on any applications that your PC will use when linked to your iCare account. These application statistics will be used for you to keep track of the amount of time you have spent on these applications over the past 7 days.

![App usage graph](screenshots/app_usage.png)

_▲ App usage on the Usage Statistics screen_

If you do not want iCare to collect your application data, you can turn this feature off in **Preferences**. Furthermore, when you delete your account the application data associated with your account will automatically be deleted from our server.

<span style="color:#ADD8E6">Note</span>: App usage collection is currently unsupported on macOS and Linux.


# 7 Insights


## 7.1 Default Insights

The default insights cards are insight cards that you are always going to get, regardless of any data or app usage statistics.

These insight cards provide great tips that you, as a user of the iCare application, would consider helpful in your journey to take care of your eyes.
![Insights screenshot](screenshots/insights_page.png)

_▲The Insights screen_


## 7.2 Custom Insights

Custom insight cards are insight cards that you will receive that are generated from your data and app usage statistics for the past 7 days.

If you do  not have any data or app usage statistics over the past 7 days, then you will not receive any custom insight cards.

## 8.4 Startup 

The Startup screen is where you can customize what happens when you start up the iCare application. You can set it so that the iCare application will start when you log into your computer and set it so that the timer will automatically start when iCare runs.

By default, both of these options are enabled.

## 8.5 Data usage

The ‘Data usage’ screen is where you can enable or disable data and/or app usage statistics. If they are disabled, then the iCare application will not collect data on your PC to send back to the server and you will be unable to generate usage statistics and custom insight cards if there is no data on the server to use.

By default, both of these options are enabled.
